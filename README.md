# 🏛️ Income Tax Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
Tax fraud poses a significant challenge to governments worldwide, leading to massive revenue losses. This project leverages **Machine Learning** to detect fraudulent tax activities efficiently. By analyzing taxpayers' financial data, we compare six algorithms to identify fraudulent patterns and deploy the best-performing model as an **Android app** using **TensorFlow Lite**.

🚀 **Key Highlights:**
- Comparison of **6 ML algorithms** for fraud detection.
- Integration with **OpenML dataset** for reproducibility.
- Deployment as an **Android app** for real-world accessibility.
- Focus on **linear & non-linear pattern recognition**.
