🕵️ Income Tax Fraud Detection using Machine Learning
<div align="center"> <img src="assets/tax-fraud-banner.png" alt="Tax Fraud Detection Banner" width="800"> <br> <em>Detecting suspicious financial patterns with machine learning</em> </div>
📌 Overview
This project combats income tax fraud by analyzing financial data patterns using 6 machine learning algorithms. Designed for governments and tax authorities, our solution identifies fraudulent tax returns with 92% accuracy (Logistic Regression) while maintaining explainability. The system is deployed as an Android app for field investigators.
