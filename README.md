# Income Tax Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to identify income tax fraud by analyzing taxpayers' financial data. The model compares six algorithms‚Äî**Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Feedforward Neural Network**‚Äîto detect fraudulent patterns in tax returns. Among these, **Logistic Regression** emerged as the most effective algorithm, capturing both linear and non-linear relationships among variables for accurate fraud detection. The model is trained on an [OpenML dataset](https://www.openml.org) and deployed as an Android app using TensorFlow Lite, making fraud detection accessible for end-users.
